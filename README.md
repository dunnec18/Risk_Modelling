# Risk_Modelling
Here we employ various parametric VaR, non-paramteric VaR, spectral risk measures and expected shortfalls for equity and interest rate portfolios. We backtest the risk measures using a rolling window method and perform a one-tailed statistical analaysis assuming th enumber of risk measure exceedances follow a binomial distribution.
